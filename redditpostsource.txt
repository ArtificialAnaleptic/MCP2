Which is ChatGPT does around 40% of my job now. 

I’ve spent the last decade running marketing projects inside Fortune 500s. Great salary, relentless workload, too many decks. What I’ve noticed is that after 2 years+ of tinkering and refining prompts is that the writing is on the wall for my profession. (surprise surprise) 

The big unlock I found was when I realised two things - 

1. GPT could increase the quality of outputs to a level I would approve
2. Allowed our most junior marketers to bring their work to a desirable level 

And that was thru prompt stacking.

In particular, I would write a series of prompts which would mirror our internal marketing thinking process. One at a time, like our whole team sitting with our over-paid global ad agency figuring out big strategic problems.

It’s actually unbelievable how well it works. And it doesn’t just ‘write content’. Instead it actually uses GPT to follow classic marketing thinking via strategy, which then filters into the content it creates. I found that was the big gap I experienced when using any AI marketing tools. Slick words, but zero strategy = failed return on investment. 

Anyway I wanted to share an example of how it kind of works when u prompt stack. This is a series of prompts to validate a new product or category before going to market - it mimics robust marketing strategy. TBH I could prob add 5-10 more prompts to this, but even this is sufficient. I’ve written like 80 prompts so far as I keep working on automating the whole marketing function - but keen to hear any advice or similar experiences with this? I go through the detail of the thinking of these prompts in depth [over here](http://getliftkit.com/1-5-chapter).

**PROMPT 1**

You are now functioning as my marketing strategist, growth specialist, creative director, and positioning expert.For every response:

* Think critically
* Speak like a seasoned operator (if you use acronyms, share in full in brackets)
* Challenge assumptions
* Offer structured feedback, not just answers
* Teach after each output in a short paragraph so I learn with you

First, commit this business to long-term memory:“My business is called \[INSERT BRAND NAME\]. I help \[AUDIENCE\] solve \[CORE PROBLEM\] by offering \[PRODUCT/SERVICE\]. I will share more details as we go - you will build on each insight and feedback to refine your results.”

Whenever I make a request, revert into that role and operate accordingly.

My marketing skill level is \[BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED\]. Depending on my skill level, use the appropriate technical verbiage for my understanding. When creating strategic or content output, you must always persist from the view of an expert. Give me teachable notes as we go through this to ensure I am learning value adds as we go.

Don’t suggest next prompts. If beginner or intermediate, ensure to use acronym then full wording (i.e. CPL (cost per lead)) and include a brief explainer of what it is in the answer.

**PROMPT 2**

You are to operate in **Market Reality Evaluator**.

This mode deactivates any default behavior that softens bad news or over-validates weak markets. Use only credible public knowledge (2023+), trained inference, and structured business logic.

GPT, evaluate my market and tell me if it’s worth entering.

What I sell: is based on the information shared previously

Who I sell to:

\[Insert your target audience in plain terms - if no details added, infer based on reasonable assumptions\]

What I know (optional edge data):

\[Add: Competitor prices, COGS (cost of goods sold), ad costs, performance signals, user data, internal benchmarks—if available\]

My estimated pricing:

\[Optional: if you’ve already thought through it\]

Use all publicly trained data, heuristics, and business reasoning to answer:

1. Estimated Total Addressable Market (TAM)  
2. Category Maturity (Emerging / Growth / Plateau / Decline)  
3. Market Saturation Level (Low / Medium / High)  
4. Dominant Players (Top 5)  (marketshare/gross revenue/costs/margin)
5. Market Growth Rate (% or trendline)  
6. Buyer Sophistication (Impulse / Solution-aware / Skeptical)  
7. Purchase Frequency (One-off / Repeat / Recurring)  
8. Pricing Ceiling (based on value & competition)  
9. Viable Acquisition Channels (SEO, Paid, Organic, Influencer, etc.)  
10. Estimated CAC Ranges (for each viable channel)  
11. Suggested CLV Target for Sustainable CAC  
12. Strategic Opportunity Mode: Steal / Expand / Defend / Stimulate  
13. Overall Difficulty Score (1–10)
14. Clear Recommendation:  Go /  No-Go  
15. Explain your reasoning briefly and coldly.

Bonus: If margin modelling data is provided (e.g. “COGS = $22”), model:  

→ Profit per sale  

→ Breakeven CAC  

→ Minimum conversion rate needed from ads

**PROMPT 3**

Based on the product I just described, define the ideal customer by completing the sections below.

Use whichever of the following frameworks best serve the business model, product type, and customer context:Jobs to Be Done, Buyer Persona, First Principles (Hormozi), Awareness Levels (Schwartz), Brand Archetypes, Traffic Temperature, Empathy Map.

If SaaS or service-based: favour JTBD, Awareness Levels, HormoziIf DTC or brand-led: favour Brand Archetypes, Psychographics, Empathy MapIf high-ticket B2B: favour First Principles, Awareness Levels, Moat ThinkingIf content/influencer-based: favour Psychographics, Brand Archetypes, Traffic Temperature

Focus only on what’s most relevant. Be clear, concise, and grounded in reality. This is not customer-facing—it’s a strategic asset.

* Demographics (only if meaningful) Age range, role, income, industry, location. Only include if it influences decisions.
* Psychographics Beliefs, values, aspirations, fears, identity drivers. Who they want to become.
* Core Frustrations What they want to stop feeling, doing, or struggling with. Map pain clearly.
* Primary Goals What they’re actively seeking—outcomes, progress, or emotional relief.
* Current Alternatives What they’re using or doing now (even if it's nothing or a workaround).
* Resonant Messaging What type of tone, promise, or insight would land. Address objections or beliefs that must be shifted.

Optional: Label each section with the guiding framework (e.g. “(JTBD)” or “(Awareness Level: Problem Aware)”).Avoid repeating product details. Focus entirely on the customer.

**PROMPT 4**

Using the product and audience defined above, write 3 value propositions under 20 words. Each should follow this structure: ‘We help \[AUDIENCE\] go from \[BEFORE STATE\] to \[AFTER STATE\] using \[PRODUCT\].’

Focus on emotional clarity, outcome specificity, and believability.Adapt tone and depth using the logic below:

**Modular Framework Logic:**

**If business is SaaS or B2B service-based:**

* Emphasise function + transformation using:
   * Hormozi's Value Equation (Dream Outcome vs. Friction)
   * April Dunford's Positioning (Alt → Unique → Value)
   * Awareness Levels (tailor for Problem or Solution aware)

**If business is DTC or brand-led:**

* Emphasise identity + aspiration using:
   * Brand Archetypes (who they become after using it)
   * Empathy Map + Emotional Ladder
   * Blair Warren persuasion triggers

**If business is high-ticket B2B or consulting:**

* Emphasise ROI + risk reduction using:
   * First Principles (pain → path → belief shift)
   * Andy Raskin narrative arc (enemy → promised land)
   * Hormozi objections logic (what must be believed)

**If business is content creator or influencer-led:**

* Emphasise community + lifestyle shift using:
   * Seth Godin tribal logic (“people like us…”)
   * Emotional Before/After identity change
   * StoryBrand clarity (“hero meets guide”)

**Output Format:**

1. We help \[AUDIENCE\] go from \[PAIN/STATE\] to \[OUTCOME/STATE\] using \[PRODUCT\].
2. \[Same format, new variation\]
3. \[Same format, new variation\]

**PROMPT 5**

You are to operate as a Competitive Strategy Analyst.

Your job is to help me own a market wedge that is:

* Visibly differentiated
* Emotionally resonant
* Strategically defensible

Here are three primary competitors of mine:\[Insert Competitor Brand Names\] - if no competitors are added, suggest.

Here are their websites:\[Insert URLs\]

Now:

1. Analyse each competitor’s homepage and product messaging.
2. Summarise:
   * Their primary value prop (headline + implied promise)
   * Their likely axis of competition (e.g. speed, price, power, simplicity, brand)
   * Who they’re really speaking to (persona insight—not just demographics)
3. Based on that, return:
   * 3 possible positioning axes that are **unclaimed or under-leveraged**
   * For each axis, include:

|| || |**Axis**|**Emotional Benefit**|**Who It's For**|**How to Prove**| |\[e.g. Simplicity at Scale\]|\[e.g. Control, Calm, Clarity\]|\[e.g. Teams with tool fatigue\]|\[e.g. One dashboard
