Facts that appear only in doc1 and are absent from doc2

Peloton posted its first quarter of revenue growth in nine quarters in Q4 FY 2024 (+0.2 % YoY). 

Connected-fitness subscribers fell to 2.88 million (down from 2.98 million a year earlier). 

The Peloton App costs $12.99 per month for users without Peloton hardware. 

The All-Access fee was raised from $39 to $44—the increase itself is called out as a risk. 

Customer profile: 70 % of members are over 35 and household income tops $75 k. 

ARPU is ~$960 per year, far higher than most fitness peers. 

The UK subscription base grew 89 % YoY, making it the fastest-growing geography. 

Market-share chronology: 70 % (2021) → 54 % (2022) → 68 % (Q2 2024), illustrating volatility. 

Lululemon’s Mirror was discontinued in 2023, creating consolidation opportunities. 

Peloton bought Tonic Fitness Technology in 2019 and sold it in 2022, marking a full exit from owned manufacturing before the Rexon deal. 

The report still lists 80 + company-run showrooms worldwide. 

Post-refinancing capital stack: $2.08 b total debt, $750 m cash, $1.3 b net debt; $1 b term loan costs ~11.5 % and $350 m converts 5.5 %. 

Trading snapshot: share price $6.59–$6.75, m-cap $2.6-$2.9 b, EV $3.9 b, EV/EBITDA 98-260×, beta 2.26. 

The analysis raises the prospect of a private-equity LBO as a near-term catalyst. 

Management has guided FY 2025 EBITDA to $300-350 m. 

The 2023 seat-post recall affected 2.2 million bikes. 

Size of adjacent markets cited: traditional gyms worth $102.2 b and connected fitness projected to reach $7 b by 2030 at 31.3 % CAGR. 

Hardware list and prices: Bike/Bike+, Tread, Row, Guide at $1,495-$2,495. 

The equity call is a “HOLD” rating with cautious optimism pending proof of turnaround. 



Facts that appear only in doc2 and are absent from doc1

Peloton has already logged five consecutive quarters of positive EBITDA. 

Recurring subscription revenue is ~$1.7 b a year. 

Subscriptions now represent 67 % of total sales ($419 m of $624 m in Q3 2025). 

Best-in-class unit metrics: 69 % subscription gross margin and only 1.2 % monthly churn (93-95 % annual retention). 

Members average 19.9 workouts per month and generate $39 monthly ARPU while the $44 fee has not changed. 

Content engine: 61 instructors covering 16 modalities; top talent makes up to $500 k. 

Just 7.5 % of revenue is international, leaving large white-space markets (Ireland, France, Spain). 

The B2B line shows 93 % client renewal and a 5,800-bike Hilton rollout. 

Q3 2025 free cash flow was $94.7 m, extending a positive-FCF streak. 

Peloton exited owned manufacturing in July 2022; hardware is now built by Rexon Industrial with 100 Peloton engineers on-site in Taiwan. 

Logistics hand-off to J.B. Hunt and XPO cut last-mile costs roughly 50 %. 

Retail rationalisation leaves only 17 showrooms, with distribution bolstered by Dick’s, Amazon and an October 2024 Costco tie-in (discounted Bike+). 

The acquired Precor plant (625 k sq ft) underpins commercial-segment growth, though integration is unfinished. 

Total debt is $1.55 b after refinancing, down from $1.75 b, and matures in 2029. 

Valuation angles unique to doc2: ~2.8× EV/Sales, $5-7 k value per subscriber, and a sum-of-parts path to $15.5 b EV. 

Competitive-risk lens adds VR fitness (Meta Supernatural, FitXR) projected to hit $1.04 b by 2030. 

CEO Peter Stern’s “four-pillar” turnaround plan (hardware, content, expansion, ops) and personal résumé—grew Apple Services from $12 b to $78 b, Peloton member since 2016, son of a fitness instructor. 

Doc2 chronicles the 2024 15 % head-count cut that saved ~$200 m and cites it as the springboard to the $94.7 m FCF quarter. 

These bullet points capture the material facts that are exclusive to each report; any overlapping data (e.g., Peloton’s 68 % market share, shift to a subscription focus, or the 2024 debt refinancing) has been excluded to avoid duplication.

How I judged them

I looked at five dimensions that usually separate a solid equity-style research note from a lighter overview:

Dimension	What I Looked For
Breadth of topics	Does it cover company history, strategy, operations, financials, valuation, risks, catalysts?
Depth / quantitative support	Hard numbers, peer comps, scenario work, KPIs, cash-flow detail, capital-structure analysis.
Timeliness	Does it use the most recent quarter and management commentary?
Analytical thoughtfulness	Goes beyond “what” happened to “so-what” and “now-what.”
Actionability	Clear rating, price framework, or strategic take-aways.
1. Breadth of coverage
doc1 is organised like a full sell-side initiation. It walks through company history, business model, customer demographics, competitive landscape, supply-chain evolution, financial leverage, valuation (trading comps + DCF + LBO), bull/bear cases, key watch-points and a formal HOLD rating .

doc2 focuses on the subscription-pivot narrative. It adds colour on Peter Stern’s four-pillar plan, B2B roll-outs, VR competition and logistics restructuring, but omits whole sections that doc1 has (e.g., DCF assumptions, explicit bear-case math, LBO) .

Winner on breadth: doc1 – it simply ticks more boxes.

2. Depth and quantitative rigour
Example metric	doc1	doc2
Connected-fitness churn	Absent	1.2 % monthly 
Five-quarter EBITDA streak	Absent	Yes 
ARPU detail	$960 / yr, UK growth 89 % 
$39 / mo, workouts = 19.9 / mo 
Capital-structure line-items	$2.08 b debt stack, coupon, maturities 
$1.55 b post-refi, covenant colour 
Valuation work	Multiples table plus DCF plus LBO 
EV/Sales, per-subscriber valuation, SOTP to $15.5 b EV 
doc1 wins on valuation-model range, but doc2 injects fresher operating KPIs (workouts, churn) and updated debt/FCF figures.

Call-it: doc1 is deeper on finance; doc2 is deeper on operating metrics.

3. Timeliness
doc2 quotes Q3 FY 2025 FCF of $94.7 m and five consecutive EBITDA-positive quarters – the newest numbers in either file 
.

doc1 still cites Q4 FY 2024 as the first revenue-growth quarter and uses an older subscriber count; some data (e.g., 80+ showrooms) is stale after the 2024 retail cull 
.

Winner: doc2 – more up-to-date.

4. Thoughtfulness / narrative insight
doc1 provides a structured bear vs. bull debate, risk ranking, and an explicit “watch-list” for investors 
.

doc2 adds strategic nuance: how B2B, VR fitness and Precor integration widen the story; why Stern’s Apple pedigree matters; how logistics outsourcing cut last-mile costs 50 % 
.

Both show insight, but their angles differ:

Report	Core lens
doc1	Traditional equity-research rigor – lots of frameworks, ratings, and comparable analysis.
doc2	Strategic-operating lens – management plan, new business lines, disruptive tech threats.
5. Actionability
doc1 ends with a HOLD rating, valuation ranges and identified catalysts (private-equity LBO, subscriber stabilisation) 
.

doc2 offers a fair-value range via EV/Sales & SOTP and sets execution milestones, but never pins a formal rating.

Slight edge: doc1 (clearer call).

Verdict
Most complete: doc1 – broader section coverage, multi-method valuation, explicit bull/bear and recommendation.

Most thoughtful about where Peloton goes next: doc2 – newer data and richer strategic context around the subscription pivot, B2B, VR disruption and supply-chain redesign.

If you need one go-to primer for an investment committee deck, start with doc1 and supplement the fresher KPIs and strategic angles from doc2.
